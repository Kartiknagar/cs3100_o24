    "1. All code you submit must compile. Programs that do not compile will receive an automatic zero. If you are having trouble getting your assignment to compile, please contact the TAs or the instructor. \n",
    "2. Make sure you do not add any new cells. You must write your code in the designated place only. We use an autograder to grade the submissions, and if your code is not in it's designated place, or you have added a new cell, the autograder may not work correctly. In particular, executing the last cell of the file always adds a new cell at the end, so you must delete this newly added cell.\n",
    "2. All assignments submitted after the deadline will be considered late, and will consume your grace days. \n",
    "3. Verify on moodle that you have submitted the correct version, before the deadline. Submitting the incorrect version before the deadline and changing it after the deadline will be counted as a late submission."
